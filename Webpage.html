                    <p>Data science is the study of data to extract meaningful insights for business.
                       It is a multidisciplinary approach that combines principles and practices from 
                       the fields of mathematics, statistics, artificial intelligence, and computer 
                       engineering to analyze large amounts of data. This analysis helps data scientists 
                       to ask and answer questions like what happened, why it happened, what will happen,
                       and what can be done with the results.

                    <h2>Course:Full Stack Developer</h2>
                    <p>A full-stack developer is a developer or engineer who can build both
                        the front end and the back end of a website. The front end (the parts
                        of a website a user sees and interacts with) and the back end (the 
                        behind-the-scenes data storage and processing) require different skill 
                        sets. Since full-stack developers are involved with all aspects of the 
                        development process, they must have expertise in both.A full-stack developer
                        can work in-house or at a computer development company that engineers websites,
                        software, and other components for other businesses.
